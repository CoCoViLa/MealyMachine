The program looks as an if-else clause that contains all the conditional expressions from the Transitions exiting the State and the actions correspondingly. That program is executed, when the state machine is at the current State, with the Javascript engine. Such an execution corresponds to a state->nextstate axiom realization, that may modify the output variables, bring us to a new or remain in the current state - all depending on the scheme.</p><p>Current implementation parses all conditions and actions and extracts variable names that must be passed to the Javascript engine before the execution and read from it after the execution. These variables must be declared, as it is described above.</p>  </div>  </div>
