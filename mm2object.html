<h1>Create a new Scheme Object from the diagram</h1>

<p>When you have finished developing the Mealy machine state diagram, select all the 
objects on the scheme (Ctrl+a) and choose File>Export>Scheme>Selection as Object...
</p>

<p>In the appearing window give to the scheme object a name (and select a suitable 
icon if you have one at hand already) and click OK.
</p>

<p>Now open the visual class in the Class Editor and define its ports 
(inputs and outputs), create/modify its icon etc.
</p>

<p>Back in Scheme Editor, when you reload the your (MySimulator) package a new icon 
appears in the toolbar and you can start using it. 
You can edit the diagram of the Mealy machine by making a right-mouse-click on the 
icon - your Mealy machine diagram is opened in a separate tab.
</p>

<p>NB! Remember always to save the diagram before executing a new simulation.</p>
