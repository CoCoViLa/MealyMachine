<h1>Create a new Scheme Object from the drawn scheme</h1>

<p>When you have finished developing the Mealy machine state chart, 
select all the objects on the scheme and choose File>Export>Scheme>Selection as Object...</p>

<p>In the appearing window give to the scheme a name (and select a suitable 
icon if you have one at hand already) and click OK.</p>

<p>Now open the visual class in the Class Editor and define its ports 
(inputs and outputs), create/modify its icon etc.</p>
<p>
Back in Scheme Editor, when you reload the your (MySimulator) package a new icon 
appears in the toolbar and you can start using it. You can edit the scheme of the 
machine by making a right-mouse-click on the icon - your scheme is opened in a 
separate tab. Remember always to save the scheme before execution a new simulation.</p>
