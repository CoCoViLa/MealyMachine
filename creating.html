<h1> Creating a Mealy state chart</h1>

<p>A Mealy state chart in the current implementation should always have one Initial State 
and one MealyMachineSupervisor block. The latter must be set as super from the 
right-mouse-click menu.</p>

<p>Introduce as many States as needed and name them properly (name field is accessible 
from Properties window, which can be opened with a double-mouse-click or a 
right-mouse-click>Properties).
</p>
<p>Introduce the Transitions between the states and define their conditional expressions 
and actions (again through the Properties window). The condition and action must be entered 
conforming Javascript syntax. Actions are executed when the Transition condition expression 
is evaluating to true and the Transition is used.</p>

<p>The conditional expression or a Transition exiting an Initial State is ignored - it is 
advised to leave it empty. The action is executed before the simulation starts and is 
typically used to give some initial evaluation to the variables used in the machine.</p>

<p>You can always leave the Transition condition field empty - this is treated as an 
expression "true". Similarly you can leave empty the action field, which is treated as no 
action.</p>

<p>When a Mealy machine reaches a Final State - no action is further executed.</p>
