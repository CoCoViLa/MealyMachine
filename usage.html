<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Typically Mealy machines are to be used as a part of a bigger (Dynamic or Discrete) 
System Simulator. 
For that the Mealy machine diagrams must be exported as an object and then these objects 
can be included in those Simulation schemes.
</p>

<p>Current CoCoViLa implementation (v.0.9.8.12) do not support a multitude of packages in a project, 
hence the content of MealyMachine package should be merged with the content of the Simulator. 
It is advisable to do as follows:
</p>

<ol> 
 <li> Make a copy of the Simulator package folder (together with all the files and 
 folders in it) and name it as you like (for example MySimulator).</li>
 <li> Rename the .xml file. It is advisable to rename it to have the same name as 
 the package folder (for example MySimulator.xml).</li>
 <li> Edit the .xml file (MySimulator.xml) and copy all the classes from the MealyMachine.xml 
 (located in the MealyMachine package folder) into it.</li>
 <li> Copy all the files (except the MealyMachine.xml) from the MealyMachine package folder 
 into MySimulator package folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, when you load the MySimulator package into CoCoViLa Scheme Editor you'll get the visual 
classes for creating Mealy machines together with the classes from the Simulator package.
