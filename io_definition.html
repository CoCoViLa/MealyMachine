<h1> Mealy state chart inputs and outputs</h1>

<p>Typically a Mealy machine uses some variables (variables that are referred to in the 
conditional expressions and actions of transitions). These variables have to be declared. 
In addition the variables that are going to be bound through the ports (input and output
connections to the external world) have to be defined as inputs and/or outputs.</p>

<p>In order to declare the variables and define the inputs and outputs open the editor 
from Scheme>Extend... and enter something similar to the following:</p>

<p>Use the following lines as an example:</p>

<code>// Variables declaration<br/>
double in1, memory, out1, out2;<br/>
// Input - output definition<br/>
inputs = [in1];<br/>
outputs = [out1, out2];<br/>
outputNames = "out1, out2";</code>
<p/>
NB! The variable list in outputs and outputNames must be identical!</p>
<p/>
<p> inputs, outputs and outputNames are predefined, so you do not need to specify their type.</p>
